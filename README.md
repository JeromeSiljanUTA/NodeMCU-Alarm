# Objective Changed
The main purpose of this project was to learn how to wire up the display drivers I had and learn how to use the NodeMCU. I was able to accomplish this by turning it into a clock

Instead of using the Weather APIs, I decided it'd be more fun to take apart a "word clock" that I had lying around and have its time be automatically set by the NodeMCU. That project is a spin off of this one and can be found here: 

## Old Description
